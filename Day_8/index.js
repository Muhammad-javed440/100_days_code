//QUESTION 22: Intentional Error: Try to produce an array index error in one of your programs. Correct
//              the error before finishing.
let array = ['Ali', 'Javed', 'Fareed'];
console.log(array[3]); // there it get an error which is called an intrnational index error
console.log(array[2]);
//QUESTION 23: Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Predict the results of each test.
let Car = true;
let car = 'Honda';
console.log(car == 'Honda');
console.log(car == 'Vigo');
console.log(car == 'Suzuki');
//QUESTION 24: More Conditional Tests: Expand your conditional tests to cover a wider range of comparisons.
// comparision between string
console.log('javed' == 'javed');
//console.log('Javed' === 'javed') This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types '"Javed"' and '"javed"' have no overlap.ts(2367)
// comparision between numbers
let a = 5;
let b = 3;
console.log(a > b);
console.log(b > a);
console.log(a < b);
console.log(b < a);
console.log(a == b);
console.log(a == b);
console.log(b == a);
